# Declaring a mount point base class

    Mount point for plugins which reger to actions that can be performed.

    #CorrectionProvider is a class, but instead of being an instance of type, the class object is now an instance of our PluginMountCorr metaclass
    #It can now serve as a mount point for plugins that provide actions.
