Subject: Re: VdM Meeting today?

Hi Dan, Monika,

A short update from my side.

1. Now we have an svn for the VdM code:

svn co svn+ssh://<username>@svn.cern.ch/reps/VdMframework

I created a standard structure inside the folder, which contains work, tags and trunk folders.

trunk - the latest version of the code
tags - for tagging particular versions of the analysis
work - developer's folder

Folder work/ contains working spaces for each one of us: Dan/, Monika/ and Olga/.

I have committed my files to work/Olga. Feel free to have a look and comment.

Please, try to commit anything in your working space and let me know if it works.

2. I have updated the corresponding parts of the VdM document.
I updated the satellite file part, all the rest corresponds to the code.

Cheers,
Olga
